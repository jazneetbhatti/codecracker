1. rename Job to Checker

2. make Checker an abstract class, with different subclasses for types of checkers. Here are some I can think of
    a. CompareChecker   -- when problem asks for program from user, single answer correct
    b. VerifyChecker    -- when problem asks for program from user, multiple answers correct
    
    design them so that 'compile and execute' is an optional step, read from codecrackerdb from problems table
    (useful for problems which ask for just output)

3. need 'compile' and 'execute' classes/standalones for all supported languages, both for user programs and checkers.

4. allow web interface to upload questions, directly to db, with necessary input/output/checker files.

5. web interface
    a. backend in Django
    b. beautiful design using Bootstrap.js or maybe handwritten (can use a little help in this area).
